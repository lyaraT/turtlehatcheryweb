        <img class="mainpic" src="Turtle-hachery-website\src\assets\images\threat.png" />
        <p class="p1">There are numerous dangers that threaten sea turtles' survival. 
         Some of the most urgent issues include habitat loss <br>brought on bycoastal development, 
         pollution from plastic waste and oil spills, climate change affecting nesting<br> locations, 
         entanglement in fishing gear, and illegal trading.To safeguard these amazing creatures
          and their delicate <br>ecosystems, conservation measures are essential.</p>

          
          <h2 class="h2-1">Habitat Loss: </h2>
          <p class="p1-2">The degradation of sea turtles' crucial breeding beaches and feeding areas is brought
             on by coastal development and<br> human activity. By reducing the number of nesting sites
              accessible due to the conversion of these regions into resorts, <br>metropolitan areas,
               or industrial locations, sea turtle numbers are reduced and their ability<br> to reproduce is hampered.<br>
              <strong>TO prevent-</strong> loss for sea turtles: enforce protected areas, regulate coastal development,<br>
               promote responsible fishing practices, reduce pollution, support beach clean-ups, educate communities,<br>
                and collaborate with conservation organizations and governments to ensure effective<br> conservation measures are implemented.<br>

               <h2 class="h2-2">Pollution:  </h2>
          <p class="p1-3">Particularly prone to pollution are oil spills and plastic waste in the ocean.<br>
             Malnutrition and intestinal obstructions can result from ingesting plastic that has been mistaken for food.<br>
              Oil spills contaminate their environments, cover the bodies and shells of turtles,<br> affecting their buoyancy,
               thermoregulation, and general well-being.<br>
               <strong>TO prevent-</strong> Reduce plastic waste, recycle, and properly dispose of fishing gear. Support organizations<br>
                working to protect sea turtles and participate in beach cleanups to prevent pollution and entanglement hazards.<br>

               <h2 class="h2-3">Climate Change:</h2>
          <p class="p1-4">Sea turtles suffer as a result of climate change's rising temperatures and sea levels.<br>
             Nesting beaches are getting smaller and smaller as a result of erosion or flooding. The turtles' <br>
             food sources are disrupted by variations in ocean currents and temperatures, which causes starvation <br>
             and difficulties during reproduction.<br>
             <strong>TO prevent-</strong>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by conserving energy, using renewable sources,<br>
              and supporting policies promoting clean energy. Protect sea turtle habitats from rising temperatures<br>
               and sea levels through conservation efforts.<br>

               <h2 class="h2-4">Fisheries Bycatch: </h2>
          <p class="p1-5">When sea turtles get trapped in fishing equipment like nets and longlines, <br>
            they frequently end up as unintended bycatch victims in fisheries. The turtles involved<br>
             in these encounters may sustain wounds, drown, or pass away. By reducing bycatch and<br>
              safeguarding sea turtle populations, sustainable fishing methods can be achieved by <br>
              using turtle-friendly fishing techniques like Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs).<br>
