       <h2>Location and Cost</h2>
  <p>Located about 2 kilometers north of Kosgoda, the Turtle Hatchery is an<br> exclusive
    research facility that plays a vital role in safeguarding endangered <br>marine turtles.

            are at their most active. During this period, visitors can fully immerse themselves in <br>
            the wonders of the Turtle Hatchery, marveling at the intricate life cycles of these gentle<br>
             beings. To access this truly unforgettable experience, an entrance fee of Rs. 500 (USD 2.5) 
             is required. It is a small price to pay for the chance to be a part of the ongoing efforts to<br>
              protect and preserve these extraordinary creatures for future generations.</p>
